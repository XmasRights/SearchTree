A simple swift structure that can find the point from a start node to an end condition, based on some predefined actions.

This project started from me attempting to do a Swift implementation of the water jug problem. As per usual, one thing led to another, and suddenly it seemed absolutely necessary to write a completely generic structure that can start at a specified `Node` and can traverse a series of `Node -> Node` actions to a final end condition.

More to come once the code is written.
